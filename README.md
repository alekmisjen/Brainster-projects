<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
Cyberware Global Defense is the final project that i worked on as stutend in Brainster academy. The project
is for real customer, where the UX/UI team had 72h to create and present design solution. The winner design we have to continue working and develop it.<p>

<p> We were given a Figma file and project specification in order to familiarize ourself with the expected design and pages.</p>

 <p>All the content(images, icons, text, headlines, links) in dowloaded from Figma and all the data is localy created in json file</p>
 <p>All the pages have same header and footer subsections as services, who we are, team, testimonials.</p>

There are few things that are not done in order for the project to be fully complited in interest of time

-Responsive design
-Few subsections are missing
-Content for switch language.
-Modal window style.
-Chat window when click on support.
-Newsletter page: add a form for becoming contributer(that opens a modal with fields to fulfill and after submit creates card and shows in the left section. When making bookmark on it, shows on the bottom section. )
