<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

Brainster Labs is first project that I worked on as studen at the Brainster Front-end Academy.
The project is a combination of all the knowladge i gain during the first three months.

The web page consists of several parts.

-Top menu-navbar(Bootstrap 5) which will contain the few links.

-Logo that will lead to the index page itself,
and other links leading to new tabs, accordingly what they
represent.

-"Hire our students" button that will take you to a new form.html page. Form have validation (Bootstrap 5)

-Banner with image and animated logo and text (css animation).
Below the banner are 3 filters for filtering project cards from different academies. (CSS, JavaScript)
(20 cards in total) 6 marketing, 10 coding and 4 design.

Pagination - on mobile devices only 6 cards are shown at first. There is load more button and everytime we click on this button, 6 new cards are loaded into the page.
